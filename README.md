# Introduction

Welcome to the Clojure Tickets project repository! This project aims to create a responsive and feature-rich flight ticket search website for finding flight tickets that meet clients's requirements.

## Overview
This Clojure program is designed to serve as a flight ticket search engine for a travel agency. It caters to two types of clients: families planning resort trips and organized tours to cities with landmarks. The goal is to provide users with various travel plans that fit their criteria, considering factors such as budget, number of connecting flights, and type of destination.
